                                                  P2P Implemntation

This implementation immplements two programs, called 'central-server' and 'peer'. 'central-server' is used to store the information of 'peer' (e.g., peer ID, peer Name, IP address, port number). 'peer' needs to register itself to 'central-server' and 'central-server' returns the connecting information to 'peer'. Multiple hosts execute the program 'peer' in certain order to form a P2P system. A host with a running 'peer' program is called as a 'peer host'. Every peer host designates a directory containing several files as its shared directory when it started. Once a peer-to-peer system is set up, any peer host can use command 'get' to download the specified file from some peer host holding the file. In order to simplify the problem, we assume all shared files have distinct file names. The file sharing is only among the peers, not the 'central-server'. 'central-server' does not participate in the file sharing.
